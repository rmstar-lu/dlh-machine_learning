"""
A function that tests for the optimum number of clusters by variance:

X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) containing the data set
kmin is a positive integer containing the minimum number of clusters to check for (inclusive)
kmax is a positive integer containing the maximum number of clusters to check for (inclusive)
iterations is a positive integer containing the maximum number of iterations for K-means

This function should analyze at least 2 different cluster sizes
You may use at most 2 loops

Returns: results, d_vars, or None, None on failure
results is a list containing the outputs of K-means for each cluster size
d_vars is a list containing the difference in variance from the smallest cluster size for each cluster size

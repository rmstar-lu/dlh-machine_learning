11-concat.py: A function that takes two pd.DataFrame objects and:

Indexes both dataframes on their Timestamp columns.
Includes all timestamps from df2 (bitstamp) up to and including
timestamp 1417411920.
Concatenates the selected rows from df2 to the top of df1 (coinbase).
Adds keys to the concatenated data, labeling the rows from df2
as bitstamp and the rows from df1 as coinbase.
You should use index = __import__('10-index').index
Returns the concatenated pd.DataFrame.
